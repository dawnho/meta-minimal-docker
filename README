I. Adding the meta-minimal-docker layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the meta-minimal-docker layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the meta-minimal-docker layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-minimal-docker \
    "


II. Misc
========

Running Docker requires additional configs, as you suspect.
meta-virtualization will get you all the required recipes but not
necessarily all the configuration required to run docker. Those are
usually found in higher order layers such as meta-overc and
meta-cloud-services.

This code is not mine, I found it off of [here](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/meta-virtualization/2017-February/002433.html).
